## Overview
The YAHBOOM G1 Tank ROS2 project is a Python-based node designed for the YAHBOOM G1 Tank, built on the Raspberry Pi 4. This project provides a flexible and customizable platform for controlling the YAHBOOM G1 Tank, with support for the Yahboom 4WD expansion board for robot car, SKU: 6000300085, and related vehicles.

The project is built on top of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2), which provides a powerful and flexible framework for developing robotic applications. The YAHBOOM G1 Tank ROS2 project uses either the turtlesim teleop executable for basic control or a gamepad, such as an Xbox controller, for control.

For more information on how to get started with this project, please refer to the documentation. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to open a new issue on the project's GitHub page.

**Key Features:**
- Controlled via `turtlesim` teleop executable.
- Controlled via 'ros-humble-teleop-twist-joy` that uses the ros2 package joy to provide gamepad support- like an xbox controller. 
- Support for the "Yahboom 4WD expansion board for robot car, SKU: 6000300085" and related vehicles.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This guide will help you set up and run the ROS2 Python node for the YAHBOOM G1 Tank with Raspberry Pi 4.

### Prerequisites

#### Hardware:
- **YAHBOOM G1 Tank**: Ensure it's fully assembled and tested for basic operations.
- **Raspberry Pi 4**: Properly interfaced with the G1 Tank.

#### Software:
- **Ubuntu 22 for Raspberry Pi**: Installed and set up on your Raspberry Pi 4. [Ubuntu installation guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#1-overview).
- **ROS2 Humble-desktop**: Installed and sourced following the official [ROS2 installation guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Humble/).
- **Colcon**: Required for building and testing ROS packages. Install with:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
  ```
For more information on installing Colcon, please refer to the official [Colcon installation guide](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/installation.html).
  
- **RPI-GPIO**: Library to control Raspberry Pi GPIO channels. Install using:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install python3-rpi.gpio
  ```

### Installation and Setup

1. **Setting Permissions**:
   If you encounter a "RuntimeError: No access to /dev/mem", adjust permissions for GPIO access on your Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod 777 /dev/mem
   sudo chmod 777 /dev/gpiomem
   ```
  

 After adjusting, reboot your Raspberry Pi.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   Navigate to your home directory, then run:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/ros2_ws/
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   git clone https://github.com/jhiggason/yahboomg1tank.git .
   ```

3. **Build the ROS2 Package**:
   Compile the project using `colcon`:
   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```

4. **Source the Workspace**:
   After building, source the workspace:
   ```bash
   source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
   ```

5. **Running the Node**:
   To activate and run your ROS2 node, execute:
   ```bash
   ros2 run tank_control_pkg tank_control
   ```

### First Use:
Upon successfully setting up and running the node, the YAHBOOM G1 Tank should now respond to the twist messages provided by the `turtlesim` teleop or any other control method you've implemented.

**Running the Turtlesim Node**
   To activate and run your turtlesim node, execute:
   ```bash
   ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key --ros-args --remap /turtle1/cmd_vel:=/cmd_vel
   ```

Use your arrow keys on your keyboard to move the tank around.

## Gamepad Setup <!-- Add a new section for Gamepad Setup -->
In this example, we are going to use an Xbox Series X/S controller, connected via Bluetooth to the Raspberry Pi, to send twist messages to the `/cmd_vel` topic, controlling our tank.

**Setting Up Xbox Controller on Ubuntu 22 for ROS 2:**

1. **Disable Secure Boot**:
   - If you are using a system other than a Raspberry Pi, please disable secure boot in your BIOS/UEFI firmware settings.

2. **Update Xbox Controller**:
   - On Windows: Connect the controller and open the 'Xbox Accessories' app. Follow on-screen instructions if an update is available.
   - On Xbox: Connect the controller, navigate to 'Settings' > 'Devices & connections' > 'Accessories'. Update if prompted.

3. **Install Xbox Driver for Ubuntu**:
   - Install Dependencies:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install dkms git
     ```
   - Get `xpadneo` from its repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/atar-axis/xpadneo.git
     cd xpadneo
     sudo ./install.sh
     ```

4. **Install Joystick Tools**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install jstest-gtk joystick
   ```

5. **Pair Xbox Controller via Bluetooth**:
   - Start the Bluetooth CLI tool:
     ```bash
     sudo bluetoothctl
     ```
   - Turn on the agent and set it as default:
     ```bash
     agent on
     default-agent
     ```
   - Scan for devices:
     ```bash
     scan on
     ```
   - Turn on your Xbox controller in pairing mode. Note its MAC address.
   - Pair, trust, and connect using the MAC address (replace 'XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX'):
     ```bash
     pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
     trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
     connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
     ```
   - Finish:
     ```bash
     scan off
     exit
     ```

6. **Install `ros-humble-teleop-twist-joy`**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ros-humble-teleop-twist-joy
   ```

7. **Adjust Xbox Joy Settings**:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/ros/humble/share/teleop_twist_joy/config/
   sudo nano xbox.config.yaml
   ```

   Edit the file and change the values to 0 and 1.
   ```bash
   enable_button: 0  # Button A
   enable_turbo_button: 1  # Button B
   ```
   Then Ctrl+O then CTRL+X

8. **Run Teleop Twist Joy**:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch teleop_twist_joy teleop-launch.py joy_config:='xbox'
   ```

Now you should be able to control your tank with the Xbox controller after pressing the "A" button on the controller and moving the left stick.
