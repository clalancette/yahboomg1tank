## Overview
A ROS2 Python node designed for the **YAHBOOM G1 Tank** built upon **Raspberry Pi 4**. Initially, it employs the teleop executable from `turtlesim` for foundational control, with plans for advanced methodologies in the pipeline.

**Key Features:**
- Controlled via `turtlesim` teleop executable.
- Support for the "Yahboom 4WD expansion board for robot car, SKU: 6000300085" and related vehicles.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This guide will help you set up and run the ROS2 Python node for the YAHBOOM G1 Tank with Raspberry Pi 4.

### Prerequisites

#### Hardware:
- **YAHBOOM G1 Tank**: Ensure it's fully assembled and tested for basic operations.
- **Raspberry Pi 4**: Properly interfaced with the G1 Tank.

#### Software:
- **Ubuntu 22 for Raspberry Pi**: Installed and set up on your Raspberry Pi 4.[Ubuntu installation guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#1-overview).
- **ROS2 Humble-desktop**: Installed and sourced following the official [ROS2 installation guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Humble/).
- **Colcon**: Required for building and testing ROS packages. Install with:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
  ```
For more information on installing Colcon, please refer to the official [Colcon installation guide](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/installation.html).
  
- **RPI-GPIO**: Library to control Raspberry Pi GPIO channels. Install using:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install python3-rpi.gpio
  ```


### Installation and Setup

1. **Setting Permissions**:
   If you encounter a "RuntimeError: No access to /dev/mem", adjust permissions for GPIO access on your Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod 777 /dev/mem
   sudo chmod 777 /dev/gpiomem
   ```
   After adjusting, reboot your Raspberry Pi.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   Navigate to your home directory, then run:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/ros2_ws/
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   git clone https://github.com/jhiggason/yahboomg1tank.git .
   ```

3. **Build the ROS2 Package**:
   Compile the project using `colcon`:
   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```

4. **Source the Workspace**:
   After building, source the workspace:
   ```bash
   source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
   ```

5. **Running the Node**:
   To activate and run your ROS2 node, execute:
   ```bash
   ros2 run tank_control_pkg tank_control
   ```


### First Use:
Upon successfully setting up and running the node, the YAHBOOM G1 Tank should now respond to the twist messages provided by the `turtlesim` teleop or any other control method you've implemented.

**Running the Turtlesim Node**
   To activate and run your turtlesim node, execute:
   ```bash
   ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_keys
   ```

Use your arrow keys to move the tank around. **Note** Right now the arrow keys move the tank, but nothing stops the tank.  To be improved in future versions.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
The Python node can be found here: [tank_control.py](https://github.com/jhiggason/yahboomg1tank/blob/main/src/tank_control_pkg/tank_control_pkg/tank_control.py)

The TankControl class is a subclass of rclpy.node.Node, which means it is a ROS2 node that can subscribe to topics and publish messages. The __init__ method sets up the GPIO pins for the left and right motors, initializes the PWM for the motors, and subscribes to the /turtle1/cmd_vel topic with the correct message type.

The listener_callback method is called whenever a message is received on the /turtle1/cmd_vel topic. It extracts the linear and angular velocities from the message and calls the drive method to control the motors accordingly. The drive method sets the direction and speed of the motors using the GPIO pins and PWM, and the stop_motors method stops the motors and cleans up the GPIO pins when the node is shut down.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/jhiggason/YahBoomG1Tank#getting-started)_
